Hello and welcome to our program for the project phase 1.
Here we simulate a Conference System where there are Attendees, Speakers, and Organizers

In order to run the conference system you need to run the main method.
In order to run the main method you must first make sure you have the correct working directory for our conference people.
make sure at the end of the directory you put \resources in order to access the given eventData, messageData, and userData.
For example, your directory should end in something along the following lines: group_0186\phase1\resources
Also make sure the use classpath of the module is the file named "phase1"

After all those settings are applied you are ready to run the program. Just go the the main method and press the run button.

From here you will be prompted with a user login. We have provided some pre defined users for you to enter based on what
menu options you want. The pre defined users are:

(Username, Password, Role)
lewis, lewis, Organizer
jon, jon, Attendee
luka, luka, Speaker
jay, jay, Organizer
simon, simon, Attendee
kelvin, kelvin, Attendee
yaosheng, yaosheng, Attendee
billgates, billgates, Organizer
Steve, Jobs, Speaker

Usernames and Passwords are case sensitive so make sure you are careful when entering those names.
For compatibility we recommend that you use the users we defined up above to see how th program works

Users will have different menu options depending on what role they are.

When you get to the menu options, you can then use your keyboard to select an option that you want to use.
Make sure to follow all the instructions we give for each menu option for the best results on the simulation

Thank you and enjoy our program!
