Hello and welcome to our program for the project phase 1.
Here we simulate a Conference System where there are Attendees, Speakers, and Organizers

In order to run the conference system you need to run the main method.
In order to run the main method you must first make sure you have the correct working directory for our conference people.
make sure at the end of the directory you put \resources in order to access the given eventData, messageData, and userData.
For example, your directory should end in something along the following lines: group_0186\phase1\resources
Also make sure the use classpath of the module is the file named "phase1"

After all those settings are applied you are ready to run the program. Just go the the main method and press the run button.
