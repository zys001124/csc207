List of design decisions + patterns we used and explanations about how our
code has improved since Phase 2:

- (Improvement) Minimized/eliminated references to entity methods in classes outside the use case layer
- (Design Pattern) Implemented the Observer design pattern to act when the amount/content of entities change
    - This was done so that both the GUI and Firebase Realtime Database could be updated
      should the contents of any use case classes change

- (Design Pattern) Implemented another kind of observer (LoginListener). This was necessary because the Observer
design pattern we implemented above listened for changes in lists of objects. This listener just
listens for a successful login.
    - Implemented this because the information required for the program to function properly for
    a given user type is different depending on the user type. So we have to wait for a successful login
    before initializing the rest of the scenes
    -Classes involved in implementation: Observable, Observer, ObserversInitializer, UpdateDatabaseOvserver
    most controllers add an observer to at least one of the managers so that they can keep the GUI updated

- (Improvement) Compartmentalizing code
    - In phase 1, ConferenceSystem.java was responsible for creating instances of every object necessary to
    for the program to run properly. These things have been compartmentalized into new classes.
    - UseCaseHolder builds all of the Managers and can add Observers to them.
    - GatewayInitializer builds and stores the gateway classes.
    - ObserversInitializer builds and stores the specific observers responsible for updating
      the Firebase Realtime Database

- (Design Pattern) Various factory methods used in ConferenceSystem to create the Initializers/holders
listed above
