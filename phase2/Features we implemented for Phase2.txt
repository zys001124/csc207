List of features we implemented for Phase2:

1. Mandatory Extensions:
    - Multiple event types implemented (talk, panel, party)
    - Organizers can only cancel events they created (fits at least one organizer criteria)
    -Both Admin and VIP accounts have been created. Admins can do everything organizers can do. They can
    delete accounts except other Admin accounts (organizers cannot delete accounts), and they can cancel
    any event they want (organizers can only cancel events they've organized).
    VIP accounts can do anything regular Attendee accounts can do but more. They can enroll in VIP only
    events and they can message whoever they want except Admins.
    - Organizers can create any type of account
    -The room capacity for every room in the conference is 60. No event can have a capacity over 60 attendees.
      Event capacity can be changed as long as the capacity is set to 60 or less.

2. Optional Extensions: (Group of 6)
    -Used a Firebase Realtime Database to store all information from our program to a database. Used gateways in order to keep with functionality
    -Created a GUI using SceneBuilder and FXML files for all menu options

3. Create Your Own Features:
    - By virtue of using Googles Firebase Realtime Database we were able to have all program information updated live.
      This means that multiple people can use the program at once and changes made to the database made by one will be
      seen by all in real time. For example, two users can message each other live with our program. (We asked our TA Sami
      and he said that firebase can count as both an Optional extension under database and as a create your own feature due to live
      updates)
    -GUI automatically updates any changes to the conference system like changing the capacity, and deleting a event.
