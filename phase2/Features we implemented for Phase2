List of features we implemented for Phase2:

1. Mandatory Extensions:
    -Organizers can only cancel events they created
    -Both Admin and VIP accounts have been created. Admins can do everything speakers can do and more. They can
    delete accounts except other Admin accounts, and they can cancel any event they want. VIP accounts can do anything
    regular Attendee accounts can do but more. They can enroll in VIP only events and they can message whoever they want
    except Admins. (Can Organizers delete accounts?)
    -The event capacity for our program is 60. No event can be initialized with more than 60 attendees.

2. Optional Extensions: (Group of 6)
    -Used firebase to store all information from our program to a database. Used gateways in order to keep with functionality
    -Created a GUI using SceneBuilder and FXML files for all menu options

3. Create Your Own Features:
    -Used Googles database system (firebase) in order to store information from our Conference System. (We asked our TA Sami
    and he said that firebase can count as both an Optional extension under database and as a create your own feature)
    -Messaging system updates live between two users logged in at the same time (thanks to firebase).
    -GUI automatically updates any changes to the conference system like changing the capacity, and deleting a event.
