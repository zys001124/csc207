Mandatory Extensions:
There will now be many types of events. A one-speaker event is the same as a "talk" from Phase 1. You can have multi-speaker events, like a panel discussion, and no-speaker events, like a party. Events can last as long as you want. You can measure the duration of an event in hours, or minutes. You get to decide. - Jay
Events can be canceled by at least one organizer. - Yaosheng
At least one more type of user will be included in your program. For example, an Admin user who can delete messages or events with no attendees, or a VIP user who can access VIP-only events. - Yaosheng
Organizers can also create Speaker accounts, Attendee accounts, and any other type of user accounts that are in your program. - Lewis
Each event has a maximum number of people who can attend it. This amount can be set when the event is created and also changed later, by an organizer. Your program should check the maximum capacity for the room where the event will be held, and prevent the number of attendees from going above the room's capacity. - Jay
